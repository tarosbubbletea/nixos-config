### NixOS-Config
Config (flake) files for my NixOS machine, using hyprland. 

Dropped it because I had to jump through too many hoops for each selfhosted service I wanted to run, many of which I would've had to write packages for (especially if they had many dependencies), instead of making use of all the pre-existing docker containers. 

These two repos could serve as reference whenever I come back to this in the future: [1](https://github.com/LongerHV/nixos-configuration/tree/e4a0a7e1018195f29d027b178013061efb5a8f8a/nixos/nasgul) [2](https://github.com/LongerHV/nixos-configuration/tree/e4a0a7e1018195f29d027b178013061efb5a8f8a/modules/nixos/homelab)

Overall, it was a somewhat nice experience for a desktop system managed somewhat akin to Ansible. However, it's a bit too high effort for servers, and not very good for messing around.
